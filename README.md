# cp-bot

## Why?

During competitive programming, we need to find the best algorithm to solve a question. The problem arises when I realize that I have already spent quite some time in searching for the algorithm in the past and searching for it again is a huge loss because time is a factor in CP comptetitions. 

So I created this simple bot in which algorithms(indirectly I mean code snippets) can be stored whenever I come across a good implementation and can be retrieved whenever necessary. 

Bot is currently hosted in replit for personal use.

## Supported Functionalities

Add, 
Get,
List(It means to list all the available snippets title)

## TODO's

1. Move from replit db to a public one.
2. Add feature to get the closest match.(Right now, the 'get' functionality will only return if it is an exact match)
